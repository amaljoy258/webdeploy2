    <h1>HTML</h1>
    <p>
      Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for
      documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by
      technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages
      such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server
      or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
      included cues for the appearance of the document. HTML elements are the
      building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other
      objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.
      HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting
      structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links,
      quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written
      using angle brackets. Tags such as img , input directly introduce content
      into the page. Other tags such as
    </p>

    <p>
      surround and provide information about document text and may include other
      tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them
      to interpret the content of the page.
    </p>

    <h1>HISTORY OF HISTORY</h1>
    <p>
      HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose
      text, images, and other material into visual or audible web pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the
      browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web
      page designer's additional use of CSS. Many of the text elements are found
      in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which
      in turn covers the features of early text formatting languages such as
      that used by the RUNOFF command developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS
      (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system: these formatting
      commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually
      format documents.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements
      (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print
      effects, with also the separation of structure and markup; HTML has been
      progressively moved in this direction with CSS.

    <h1>WWW</h1>
    <p>
      The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information
      system where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform
      Resource Locators (URLs, such as https://example.com/), which may be
      interlinked by hypertext, and are accessible over the Internet.[1][2] The
      resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol
      (HTTP) and may be accessed by users by a software application called a web
      browser and are published by a software application called a web server.
      The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet, which pre-existed
      the Web in some form by over two decades and upon whose technologies the
      Web is built.

    <h1>XML</h1>
    <p>
      Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that defines a set
      of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable
      and machine-readable. The World Wide Web Consortium's XML 1.0
      Specification[2] of 1998[3] and several other related
      specifications[4]—all of them free open standards—define XML.[5] The
      design goals of XML emphasize simplicity, generality, and usability across
      the Internet.[6] It is a textual data format with strong support via
      Unicode for different human languages. Although the design of XML focuses
      on documents, the language is widely used for the representation of
      arbitrary data structures[7] such as those used in web services. Several
      schema systems exist to aid in the definition of XML-based languages,
      while programmers have developed many application programming interfaces
      (APIs) to aid the processing of XML data.

    <h1>APPLET</h1>
    <p>
      In computing, an applet is any small application that performs one
      specific task that runs within the scope of a dedicated widget engine or a
      larger program, often as a plug-in.[1] The term is frequently used to
      refer to a Java applet, a program written in the Java programming language
      that is designed to be placed on a web page. Applets are typical examples
      of transient and auxiliary applications that don't monopolize the user's
      attention. Applets are not full-featured application programs, and are
      intended to be easily accessible.
